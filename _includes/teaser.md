CloudCV began in the summer of 2013 as a research project within the Machine Learning and Perception lab at Virginia Tech, with the ambitious goal of democratizing computer vision and machine learning. Weâ€™re a young community working towards enabling developers, researchers, and fellow students to leverage Artificial Intelligence technology as a service and to share state of the art algorithms with the research community.

We have participated in the past two installments of Google Summer of Code, over the course of which our students built several excellent tools and features. If you are interested in participating as a student or mentor, scroll down to check out our projects and get involved!
